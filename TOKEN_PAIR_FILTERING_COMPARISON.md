# Token Pair Filtering: Comparison of Approaches

## Quick Comparison Table

| Approach | Data Volume | Setup Complexity | Flexibility | Best For |
|----------|-------------|------------------|-------------|----------|
| **Mint Filter** | Medium | Low | High | Getting started |
| **Pool Filter** | Very Low | High | Low | Production/High frequency |
| **Post-Filter** | High | Very Low | Very High | Development/Testing |
| **Hybrid** | Low-Medium | Medium | High | **Recommended** |

## 1. Mint-Based Filtering (Recommended for Starting)

### How it Works
Subscribe to all transactions involving specific token mints.

### Implementation
```rust
let token_mints = vec![
    "So11111111111111111111111111111111111111112".to_string(), // SOL
    "EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v".to_string(), // USDC
];

let transaction_filter = TransactionFilter {
    account_include: token_mints,
    account_exclude: vec![],
    account_required: vec![],
};
```

### Data Reduction
- Monitor 2 tokens: ~80% reduction vs monitoring all
- Monitor 5 tokens: ~60% reduction
- Monitor 10 tokens: ~40% reduction

### Pros
✅ Simple to configure (just need token addresses)
✅ Catches all pools for your pairs automatically
✅ Discovers new pools as they're created
✅ Good balance of simplicity and efficiency

### Cons
❌ Still receives some irrelevant data (other pairs with your tokens)
❌ More data than pool-specific filtering

### Best For
- Getting started quickly
- Monitoring 3-10 token pairs
- When you don't know all pool addresses
- Development and testing

---

## 2. Pool-Based Filtering (Most Efficient)

### How it Works
Subscribe directly to specific pool account addresses.

### Implementation
```rust
let pool_addresses = vec![
    "POOL_ADDRESS_1".to_string(),
    "POOL_ADDRESS_2".to_string(),
    "POOL_ADDRESS_3".to_string(),
];

let account_filter = AccountFilter {
    account: pool_addresses,
    owner: vec![],
    filters: vec![],
};
```

### Data Reduction
- ~95-99% reduction vs monitoring all
- Only receives events for your specific pools

### Pros
✅ Minimal data volume (most efficient)
✅ Lowest latency (less processing)
✅ Predictable costs
✅ Best for high-frequency trading

### Cons
❌ Requires finding pool addresses first
❌ Misses new pools unless you update config
❌ More complex setup
❌ Need separate addresses for each DEX

### Best For
- Production high-frequency trading
- Monitoring 5-20 specific pools
- When data costs matter
- Stable, well-known pools

---

## 3. Post-Filtering in Code (Most Flexible)

### How it Works
Subscribe to everything, filter in your callback.

### Implementation
```rust
let monitored_pairs = HashSet::from([
    (sol_mint, usdc_mint),
    (sol_mint, usdt_mint),
]);

// In callback:
if monitored_pairs.contains(&(e.source_mint, e.destination_mint)) {
    // Process this event
} else {
    // Ignore
}
```

### Data Reduction
- 0% reduction at network level
- Reduced processing time (skip unwanted events)

### Pros
✅ Easiest to implement
✅ Can change pairs without reconnecting
✅ No need to find pool addresses
✅ Great for development

### Cons
❌ Receives all data (high bandwidth)
❌ Higher costs (if charged by data volume)
❌ More CPU usage
❌ Not suitable for production

### Best For
- Quick prototyping
- Development and debugging
- When you frequently change monitored pairs
- Learning the system

---

## 4. Hybrid Approach (Recommended for Production)

### How it Works
Combine mint filtering at subscription level + post-filtering in code.

### Implementation
```rust
// Step 1: Filter by mints at subscription
let transaction_filter = TransactionFilter {
    account_include: vec![sol, usdc, usdt],
    // ...
};

// Step 2: Further filter in callback
let monitored_pairs = HashSet::from([
    (sol, usdc),  // Only want SOL/USDC
    (sol, usdt),  // And SOL/USDT
    // But NOT usdc/usdt
]);

// In callback:
if monitored_pairs.contains(&(e.source_mint, e.destination_mint)) {
    // Process
}
```

### Data Reduction
- ~70-90% reduction vs monitoring all
- Best balance of efficiency and flexibility

### Pros
✅ Good data reduction
✅ Flexible (change pairs without reconnecting)
✅ Catches new pools automatically
✅ Can adjust pair selection on the fly

### Cons
❌ Slightly more complex than single approach
❌ Not as efficient as pure pool filtering

### Best For
- **Most production use cases**
- Monitoring 5-20 token pairs
- When you want flexibility + efficiency
- Gradual transition from dev to production

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Small Retail Arbitrage Bot
**Goal:** Monitor SOL/USDC and SOL/USDT on 2-3 DEXes

**Recommended:** Mint-Based Filtering
```rust
let mints = vec![SOL, USDC, USDT]; // 3 tokens
// Results: ~75% data reduction, 5 minutes to setup
```

### Example 2: Medium-Scale Multi-Pair Bot
**Goal:** Monitor 10 pairs across multiple DEXes

**Recommended:** Hybrid Approach
```rust
let mints = vec![SOL, USDC, USDT, BONK, JUP, mSOL]; // 6 tokens
let pairs = vec![
    (SOL, USDC), (SOL, USDT), (SOL, BONK),
    (USDC, USDT), // etc...
];
// Results: ~85% data reduction, good flexibility
```

### Example 3: High-Frequency Focused Bot
**Goal:** Ultra-low latency for SOL/USDC only

**Recommended:** Pool-Based Filtering
```rust
let pools = vec![
    RAYDIUM_SOL_USDC_POOL,
    ORCA_SOL_USDC_WHIRLPOOL,
    JUPITER_SOL_USDC_ROUTE,
];
// Results: ~98% data reduction, <1ms latency
```

## Migration Path

Use **Post-Filtering**
- Quick to implement
- Easy to debug
- Test different pairs rapidly

### Phase 2: Testing (Week 2-3)

- Pool filtering for top 5 pairs
- Mint filtering for secondary pairs
- Post-filtering for experimental pairs

| Mint Filter (3 tokens) | ~12 GB | $36 |
| Pool Filter (10 pools) | ~1.5 GB | $4.50 |
| Hybrid | ~7 GB | $21 |

**Note:** Costs vary by provider and usage patterns. Always verify with your provider.

Start Here
    ↓
    Do you know specific pool addresses?
    ├─ YES → Are you monitoring <10 pools?
    │        ├─ YES → Use Pool-Based Filtering
    │        └─ NO → Use Hybrid Approach
    │
    └─ NO → Are you in development?
            ├─ YES → Use Post-Filtering
            └─ NO → Use Mint-Based Filtering
```

## Common Questions

### Q: Can I mix approaches?
**A:** Yes! Use pool filtering for high-priority pairs and mint filtering for others.

### Q: How many pairs should I monitor?
**A:** Start with 2-3, expand to 10-15 as you understand the market.

### Q: Do I need all pool addresses?
**A:** No. Mint filtering will catch pools automatically. Pool addresses are optional for optimization.

### Q: What if a new pool is created?
**A:** Mint filtering catches it automatically. Pool filtering requires updating your config.

### Q: Which approach for a beginner?
**A:** Start with Mint-Based Filtering (see `focused_arbitrage_example.rs`)
